# Human Evolution Exam Review 2
EVO EXAM on Thursday
	- Go through all the monkey stuff and study the names and such
		- One hand written page of notes
			- Front and back
		- Chapters 6,7,9 and a little 9
		- Definitely study the kahoot
		- You can redo the inquizitives to practice

## Stuff to write down
### Kahoot Questions
- Dietary plasticity in primates refers to the ability to meet nutritional needs by many foods
- The typical dental formula of lorises and lemurs is 2/1/3/3
- Strepsirrhines’ specialized lower incisors and canines are called a tooth comb
- The Y-5 molar morphology is present in chimpanzees
- Among primates humans have the largest brain relative to body size
- Primate vision has overlapping fields of vision & depth perception
- The first major cladistic division of primates is Strepsirrhini & Haplorrhini
- Haplorrhines include tarsiers, monkeys and apes
- Variation in living primates provides models for morphology, behavior and past adaptations
- Catarrhines’ nostrils are close together and face downward
- Prehensile tails are common in platyrrhines
- Brachiation refers to using arms to swing in trees
- Orangutans are hominoids
- Suspensory primates are identified by longer arms and legs
- Hominoids have no tail
- A lack of sexual dimorphism in gibbons indicates decrease mate competition
- Kin selection involves altruism increasing relative’s fitness
- A strepsirrhine is characterized by wet nose, snout, tooth comb and grooming claw
- Strepsirrhines include lemurs, lorises and galagoes
- About half of all primates are endangered
- Not all chimps use the same tools, but mothers do teach tool use to their children
- Ethno-primatology is the study of human-primate interactions
- Chimps have been trained to communicate using American Sign Language
- The study of what happens after death to remains is called taphonomy
- Rapid evolutionary change with static periods is called punctuated equilibrium
- Cultural dating can date ceramics
- The time it takes for half of an isotope to decay is called its half-life
- Fossil apes with long arms lived in forests 
- The most distinctive ape dentition feature is the Y-5 Molar
- Species A found below B is older by the law of superposition
- Food quality refers to the readily digestible energy and protein 
- Tool use and learning in primates shows their material culture 
- Primates communicate through vocalizations and gestures
- The climate was dry and seasonal when the early hominins first appeared. 
- The placement of fossils in time is called chronological sequence
- The Miocene epoch saw a radiation of apes
