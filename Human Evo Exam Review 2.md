# Human Evolution Exam Review 2
EVO EXAM on Thursday
	- Go through all the monkey stuff and study the names and such
		- One hand written page of notes
			- Front and back
		- Chapters 6,7,9 and a little 9
		- Definitely study the kahoot
		- You can redo the inquizitives to practice

## Stuff to write down
### Kahoot Questions
- Dietary plasticity in primates refers to the ability to meet nutritional needs by many foods
- The typical dental formula of lorises and lemurs is 2/1/3/3
- Strepsirrhines’ specialized lower incisors and canines are called a tooth comb
- The Y-5 molar morphology is present in chimpanzees
- Among primates humans have the largest brain relative to body size
- Primate vision has overlapping fields of vision & depth perception
- The first major cladistic division of primates is Strepsirrhini & Haplorrhini
- Haplorrhines include tarsiers, monkeys and apes
- Variation in living primates provides models for morphology, behavior and past adaptations
- Catarrhines’ nostrils are close together and face downward
- Prehensile tails are common in platyrrhines
- Brachiation refers to using arms to swing in trees
- Orangutans are hominoids
- Suspensory primates are identified by longer arms and legs
- Hominoids have no tail
- A lack of sexual dimorphism in gibbons indicates decrease mate competition
- Kin selection involves altruism increasing relative’s fitness
- A strepsirrhine is characterized by wet nose, snout, tooth comb and grooming claw
- Strepsirrhines include lemurs, lorises and galagoes
- About half of all primates are endangered
- Not all chimps use the same tools, but mothers do teach tool use to their children
- Ethno-primatology is the study of human-primate interactions
- Chimps have been trained to communicate using American Sign Language
- The study of what happens after death to remains is called taphonomy
- Rapid evolutionary change with static periods is called punctuated equilibrium
- Cultural dating can date ceramics
- The time it takes for half of an isotope to decay is called its half-life
- Fossil apes with long arms lived in forests 
- The most distinctive ape dentition feature is the Y-5 Molar
- Species A found below B is older by the law of superposition
- Food quality refers to the readily digestible energy and protein 
- Tool use and learning in primates shows their material culture 
- Primates communicate through vocalizations and gestures
- The climate was dry and seasonal when the early hominins first appeared. 
- The placement of fossils in time is called chronological sequence
- The Miocene epoch saw a radiation of apes

	- Apes
		- Chimpanzees
		- Gibbons
		- Gorillas
		- Orangutans
	- Monkeys
		- Baboons
		- Macaques
		- Capuchins
		- Etc.
	- Tarsiers
		- Tarsiers
	- Strepsirrhines

		- Lorises
		- Galagoes
- What makes a primate a primate?
	1. Grasping hands and feet
		- Pentadactyly
			- Opposable thumb
		- Nails (not claws)
			- Sensitive tactile pads
			- Callitrichids have re-developed claws
		- Power and precision grip
	2. Several aspects of visual system
		 - Vision is enhanced
		 - Forward facing eyes
			 - Stereoscopic vision
		- Increase acuity
		- Trichromatic color vision
	3. Large complex brains and associated behavior
		- Closed orbital bar
		- Accurate depth perception
		- Overlap in the visual field from each eye creates 3D vision
	4. Skeletal and dental features
		- Large brains relative to body size compared to other mammals
		- In primates the neocortex makes up 50-80% of the brain’s total volume
			- Responsible for reasoning and consciousness
			- Link between large brain and sociality and learning
- Altricial Newborns
	- Birth of relatively helpless young
	- Little reliance on instinct
	- Social learning is important
	- Infants are dependent on mothers
		- Grasping hands used to cling
	- Long periods of post natal care for babies
		- Great ability to learn from experience and rely heavily on learning
- Sociality is important for survival
	- Use sociality as an adaptation
		- Group size and composition varies widely between species
- Unspecialized skeleton
	- Clavicle and collar bone is present
		- Allows for greater range of motion
		- Retention of 2 bones in
			- Arm
			- Lower leg
			-
