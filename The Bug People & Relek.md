# The Bug People
- They harvest relek from under the crust of the earth in order to use for some sort of function like bathing in it to have mind transformations

All the information i know so far about them

There is an underground lab inside a mountian where relek is refined and turned into some sort of oil or at least the oil relek is harvested there

Families are lured to live near the factory using cult tactics people bring there kids and move in there and they start going to school there not knowing of anything thappening underground
- Then behind a secret door wall in the computer lab is a long path to the relek harveesting station

In a seperate instance in the outer space, fbw style, there are the three who have sent a bomb to the planet (earth) and exploded off the crust to reveal the layer of relek from beneath the crust
- They peel it up like it is cinnamon bark from upon the earth benieth the crust and cut out large rectangles and transport it and use it

- Bug people and swim in the fluid relek and it allows them to regenerate or reset or something or at least when viewed the viewer and see and feel the bug person like compress in the bug persons mind palace and become refreshed
	- It seems to be a necessity once in a while
	- Its some sort of transformation
	- Its important for prospective bug people (usually the children of bug people, for some reason all bug peoples children are human)
		- I think the bug people themselves cant reproduce because since they are just hosted in human bodies the human reproduces like normal not coming with a bug person pre-installed.
- Important thing to mention 
- ### birth of the bug person
- A larva has to be inserted into the back of a human child like puberty to 20 age it seems college age or younger. 
- I just remembered bug people larva are born from the remains of 
- In the cult thats in the mountian they force humans to have intercourse with animals in the field of fertility in order to create instantly growing and birthing human/animal hybr
