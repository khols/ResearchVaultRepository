# The Bug People
- They harvest relek from under the crust of the earth in order to use for some sort of function like bathing in it to have mind transformations

All the information i know so far about them

There is an underground lab inside a mountian where relek is refined and turned into some sort of oil or at least the oil relek is harvested there

Families are lured to live near the factory using cult tactics people bring there kids and move in there and they start going to school there not knowing of anything thappening underground
- Then behind a secret door wall in the computer lab is a long path to the relek harveesting station

In a seperate instance in the outer space, fbw style, there are the three who have sent a bomb to the planet (earth) and exploded off the crust to reveal the layer of relek from beneath the crust
- They peel it up like it is cinnamon bark from upon the earth benieth the crust and cut out large rectangles and transport it and use it

- Bug people and swim in the fluid relek and it allows them to regenerate or reset or something or at least when viewed the viewer and see and feel the bug person like compress in the bug persons mind palace and become refreshed
	- It seems to be a necessity once in a while
	- Its some sort of transformation
	- Its important for prospective bug people (usually the children of bug people, for some reason all bug peoples children are human)
		- I think the bug people themselves cant reproduce because since they are just hosted in human bodies the human reproduces like normal not coming with a bug person pre-installed.
- Important thing to mention 
- ### birth of the bug person
- A larva has to be inserted into the back of a human child like puberty to 20 age it seems college age or younger. 
- I just remembered bug people larva are born from the remains of 
- In the cult thats in the mountian they force humans to have intercourse with animals in the field of fertility in order to create instantly growing and birthing human/animal hybrid creatures (imagine animals missing parts and have human parts growing off usually limbs) 
	- The human doesnt remember what they have to go through while its happening
		- Once the homunculus/chimera is born the human remembers
		- The chimera is born within minutes of the aformentioned act because they grow and birth rly fast (idk if its the bug people techology or the field of fertilities magic powers of if both theose things are the same thing which is probably the case)
	- I think the bug people can only eat humochimera meat because they need to eat humans like bugs do but they want to be independent so they made a way to grow human meat using animals growing extra limbs off them?
	- The scientists in the mountian are extremely evil of the most evil kind that cannot be expressed in words and only felt
	- Same with the humans in the field have all been taken advantage of to the utmost degree and it is not their faults at all evil people manipulated them into a position of safety and then took advantage. One should always stand with the victims especially here because i was one of them.
- In the idyllic woods where teacher is when the kids refer to “the three from space” they are mentioning the people who are peeling the relek out of the planet in space
	- This adds up for when the kids said the people from space were creepy
	- I am 95% sure the bug people are the people from space
Ok back to the bug people
They put a larva in your back that i think somehow likes the spine i think it replaces the spine if i remember through a big port in the upper back that is somehow put there but the bug people who are converting the human
- I think it was insinuated that it was jabbed out or something
- The bug people look like regular humans after this and retain the bodies original conciousness, the larvas dont seem to have conciousness which doesnt full make sense because if it didnt why would they be able to continue making more bug people or organaize a factory big enough to own a mountian and go to space to harvest planets?)
- As far as i could tell it stays the original person but probably the larva exerts some sort of force on the person that may or may not get progressively stronger
- The bug people dont have hu m an morals they dont follow rules and they are not kind
- There are sort of relics or holy objects that are against the bug people but idk what they really do ive never seen an interaction
	- Ive only seen them or felt them rather such like a golden tablet with two clocks on it that look like a big pokemon card
- The bug people can fly and have wings and are very strong and fast i think they can live longer but i cant fully remember
