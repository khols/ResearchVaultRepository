# APY108 Intro to Archaeology

### Excavation
- Digging → excavation gives us a lot of information about a small area of the site
- Layout a grid to help keep track of where the material comes from
	- Sometimes use stakes to denote coordinates
	- Always a scale bar will be placed in frame
- Carefully collect and sort artifacts
- Make maps to record
### Excavation Techniques
- Subdivided into those that stress
	- Where the artifacts are found
	- Horizontal dimension
		- North or south or east or west
	- Vertical dimension
		- How far down
		- Every objects elevation is written down
- Different sites require different methods
### Collecting Artifacts
- All artifacts are collected by provenience
- After collected → artifacts are examined by a specialist
### Screening/Sieving
- Purpose is to recover as complete a sample as necessary to address questions
- Flotation screening allows you to find botanical remains and very small artifacts (<1mm)
### Archaeological Remains
- The most visible relics are the rarities
	- Pollen, pottery, debitage
- Most remains are very small
### Artifacts vs. Ecofacts
- Artifacts is any moveable object that has been used, modified, or manufactured by humans
- Ecofacts are the remains of plants or animals found at archaeological sites.
#### Feature
- A nonportable archaeological evidence such as fire hearths, architectural elements, artifact clusters, garbage pits, soil stains.
