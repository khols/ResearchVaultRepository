> > Science is taught dogmatically, as revealed truth. Accordingly the power that the term “science” exercises over the minds of the general public has a quasi-mystical and irrational nature. For the general public, and many scientists as well, science is like a kind of black magic, and its authority is at once indisputable and incomprehensible.

> > Moreover, it does not (as the others do) restrict itself merely to the claim that its own myths are true. On the contrary, it is the only religion which has the arrogance to assert that it is based not on myth, but on Reason alone, and to present as “tolerance” the particular blend of intolerance and amorality that it fosters.

> > In the eyes of the general public the priests and high priests of this religion are the scientists in the broad sense, and, more generally, the technologists, the technocrats, the experts.

> > The overwhelming majority of scientists are quite willing to accept their role as priests and high priests of the dominant religion of today. They are steeped in it to a greater extent than anybody else , the more so the higher their position in the scientific hierarchy. To any attack on this religion or any of its dogmas or by-products they will react with all the emotional violence of a ruling elite whose privileges are being threatened4.

> > Myth 1: Only scientific knowledge is true or real knowledge; that is, only knowledge which can be expressed quantitatively, or formalized, or repeated at will under laboratory conditions, can be the content of true knowledge

> > This confines “true knowledge” to the few million scientists on the planet. Babies and children have no knowledge worth speaking of, nor does any person without scientific training. True knowledge begins with the last terms of a university education.

> > as ethics is an object of knowledge, it can be investigated by scientific methods: it follows that science becomes the foundation of ethics

> War thus becomes acceptable, as an object of scientific observation. Moreover, it acts as an important regulating factor for demographic and economic processes, as well as a stimulating element for science and technology. The subjective meaning of war for those who endure it or wage it is ignored, except as an object of “scientific” investigations whose aims are often manipulative, and whose final objective is the reduction of the life process to statistics.

> > The fact that the basic physical laws can now be expressed in statistical form enables the mechanist viewpoint to transcend the strictly determinist conception of nature, and in principle to reincorporate the idea of free will.

> > Any hint at an explanation of natural phenomena in terms of final causes is contemptuously dismissed, at least within natural science.

> This idea of *final causes* is brought up in [[A Guide for the Perplexed]].

> > Occasionally a single person may be an expert in more than one field, but nobody can be an expert in many fields. Nevertheless, a genuine understanding of any question about concrete reality requires the analysis of a great number of interconnected aspects, belonging to many different scientific fields. Reducing such analysis to a few or just one of these aspects would mutilate reality.

> > during the last few centuries there has been an increasingly intransigent affirmation of the superiority of reason and intellect over all other aspects of human experience and capacities, in particular, sensual, emotional and ethical aspects.

> > On the expert, who feels himself to be among the chief beneficiaries of these myths designed to strengthen his collective power, they have a crippling effect, both spiritually and intellectually, as they carry him ever farther away from the harmony of living things, turning him into an ever more specialized servomechanism. They have a paralyzing effect on layman and expert alike – paralyzing with respect to the inborn desire to understand more about nature, life and ourselves than is expressible by a single specialized jargon, and consequently, paralyzing with respect to moral commitment and personal responsibility in all fields involving society as a whole, because they contribute to widening the ever-increasing gap between the three poles of human experience: thought, emotion and action.

> > This mindless race and reckless growth have resulted in the present ecological crisis, whose early stages we are only beginning to witness, and have led us to a major crisis in our civilization.

> > We believe that, in the coming years, the chief political dividing line will fall less and less within the traditional division between “right” and “left”, but increasingly among the adherents of scientism, who advocate “technological progress at any price”, and their opponents, i.e,. roughly speaking, those who regard the enhancement of life, in all its richness and variety, as being the supreme value.

> > ncreasing disillusionment and scepticism are expressed about the “miracles” of science and technology, their claim to be the key to human happiness, and their ability to solve the problems that they themselves have created.

> > This reaction often leads to an emphasis on the mystical, magical, or religious aspects of human experience. Thus, paradoxically, science, which was supposed to eliminate these aspects, has, on the contrary, through the very excesses of the ideology of scientism, contributed to their rebirth

> > a considerably larger number of opponents seems likely to emerge in the coming years, in the West at least, because of the increase in the ranks of trained scientists and technicians who are going to be unemployed, or employed in a profession for which they were not trained, or with a status and salary considerably below that which they feel their scientific competence entitles them.

> This is exactly what happened, but the opposition fought back by destroying community to the point no one can voice concern.
