> [!Quote] Pg. 3 par. 1
> After all, matters that are beyond doubt are, in a sense, dead; they constitute no challenge to the living. 
> 
> To accept anything as true means to incur the risk of error. If I limit myself to knowledge that I consider true beyond doubt, I minimize the risk of error, but at the same time I maximize the risk of missing out on what may be the subtlest, most important and most rewarding things in life.
> 
> Maybe it is [necessary] so that the *higher* things cannot be known with the same degree of certainty as can the *lesser* things, in which case it would be a very great loss indeed if knowledge were limited to things beyond the possibility of doubt.

> [!Quote] Pg. 5 par. 1
>  People are asking for bread and they are being given stones. They beg for advice about what they should do "to be saved," and they are told that the idea of salvation has no intelligible content and is nothing but an infantile neurosis. They long for guidance about how to live as responsible human beings, and they are told that they are machines, like computers, without free will and therefore without responsibility.

> [!Quote] Pg. 6 par. 3
> Socrates said: "Wonder is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins with wonder."

> [!Quote] Pg. 9 par. 3
> Jacques Maritain comments: "The mathematical knowledge of nature, for Descartes, is not what it is in reality, a certain interpretation of phenomena... Which does not answer questions bearing upon the first principles of things. This knowledge is, for him, the revelation of the very essence of things. These are analysed exhaustively by geometric extension and local movement. The whole of physics, that is, the whole of the philosophy of nature, is nothing but geometry. 
> 
> Thus Cartesian evidence goes straight to mechanism. It mechanizes nature; it does violence to it; it annihilates everything which causes things to symbolize with the spirit, to partake in the genius of the Creator, to speak to us. The universe becomes dumb."

> [!Quote] Pg. 13 par. 1
> "... The traditional wisdom of all peoples in all parts of the world, have become virtually incomprehensible to modern man, although he, too, desires nothing more than somehow to be able to rise above "the whole state of the present life." He hopes to do so by growing rich, by moving around at ever-increasing speed, by traveling to the moon and into space."

> [!Quote] Pg. 17 par. 1
> Consciousness and intelligence, as it were, recoil upon themselves. There is not merely a conscious being, but a being capable of being conscious of its consciousness; not merely a thinker, but a thinker capable of watching and studying his own thinking. There is something able to say "I" and *to direct consciousness* in accordance with its own purposes, a master or controller, a power at a higher level than consciousness itself.

> [!Quote] Pg. 19 par. 2
> Physics and chemistry deal with the lowest level, "minerals." At this level, *x*, y, z--life, consciousness, and self-awareness--do not exist (or, in any case, are totally inoperative and therefore cannot be noticed). Physics and chemistry can tell us nothing, *absolutely nothing*, about them. These sciences posess no concepts relating to such powers and are incapable of describing their effects.

> [!Quote] Pg. 25 par. 2
> In a hierarchic structure, the higher does not merely possess powers that are additional to and exceed those possessed by the lower; it also has power *over* the lower: it has the power to organize the lower and use it for its own purposes. Living beings can organize and utilize inanimate matter, conscious beings can utilize life, and self-aware beings can utilize consciousness.

> [!Quote] Pg. 27 par. 1
> At the human level, there is a subject that says "I"--a person: another marked change from passivity to activity, from object to subject. To treat a person as if he or she were a mere object is a perversity, not to say a crime. No matter how weighed down and enslaved by circumstances  a person may be, there always exists the possibility of self-assertion and rising above circumstances. Man can achieve a measure of control over his environment and thereby his life, utilizing things around him for his own purposes. There is no definable limit to his possibilities, even though he everywhere encounters practical limitations which he has to recognize and respect. 

> [!Quote] Pg. 31 par 1-3
> Man has obviously much more inner unity than any being below him, although integration, as modern psychology recognizes, is not guaranteed to him at birth and attaining it remains one of his major tasks. As a biological system, he is most harmoniously integrated; on the mental plane, integration is less perfect but capable of considerable improvement through schooling. As a *person*, however, as a being with the power of self-awareness, he is generally so poorly integrated that he experiences himself as an assembly of many different personalities, each saying "I." The classic expression of this experience is found in Saint Paul's letter to the Romans
> 	 
> 	 "My own behavior baffles me. For I find myself not doing what I really want to do but doing what I really loathe. Yet surely if I do things that I really don't want to do, it cannot be said that "I am doing them at all,--it must be sin that has made its home in my nature."
> 	 
>  Integration means the creation of an inner unity, a center of strength and freedom, so that the being ceases to be a mere object, acted upon by outside forces, and becomes a subject, acting from its own "inner space" into the space outside itself.

> [!Quote] Pg. 33 par. 2
> The "invisibility of man" has been incisively described by Maurice Nicoll:
> 
> "We can all see another person's body directly. We see the lips moving, the eyes opening and shutting, the lines of the mouth and face changing, and the body expressing itself as a whole in action. The person *himself* is invisible... If the invisible side of people were discerned as easily as the visible side, we would live in a *new humanity*. As we are, we live in a visible humanity, a humanity of *appearances*. ... All our thoughts, emotions, feelings, imaginations, reveries, dreams, fantasies, are *invisible*. All that belongs to our scheming, planning, secrets, ambitions, all our hopes, fears, doubts, perplexities, all our affections, speculations, ponderings, vacuities, uncertainties, all our desires, longings, appetites, sensations, our likes, dislikes, aversions, attractions, loves and hates-- all are themselves invisible. The constitute "oneself.""

> [!Quote] Pg. 34 subchapter IV
> The degree of integration, of inner coherence and strength, is closely related to the kind of "world" that exists for beings at different levels. Inanimate matter has no "world". Its total passivity is equivalent to the total emptiness of its world. A plant as a "world" of its own--a bit of soil, water, air, light, and possibly other influences--a "world" limited to its modest biological needs. The world of any one of the higher animals is incomparably greater and richer, although still mainly determined by biological needs, as modern animal psychology studies have amply demonstrated. But it also contains something more-such as curiosity, which enlarges the animal's world beyond its narrow biological confines. 
> 
> The world of man, again, is incomparably greater and richer; indeed, it s asserted in traditional philosophy that man is *capax universi*, capable of bringing the whole universe into his experience. What he will actually grasp depends on each person's own Level of Being. The "higher" the person, the greater and richer is his or her world. A person, for instance, entirely fixed in the philosophy of materialistic scientism, denying the reality of "invisibles" and confining his attention solely to what can be counted, measured, and weighted, lives in a very poor world, so poor that he will experience it as a meaningless wasteland unfit for human habitation. Equally, if he sees it as nothing but an accidental collocation of atoms, he must needs agree with Bertrand Russell that the only rational attitude is one of "unyielding despair."

> [!Quote] Pg. 35 par. 2
> If we take the "fourth dimension"--time-- into consideration, a similar picture emerges. At the lowest level, there is time only in sense of duration. For creatures endowed with consciousness there is time in the sense of experience; but experience is confined to the present, except where the past is made present through memory (of one kind or another) and the future is made present through foresight (of which, again, there may be different kinds). The higher the Level of Being, the broader, as it were, is the present, the more it embraces of what, at lower Levels of Being, is past and future. At the highest imaginable Level of Being, there would be the "*eternal now*."

> [!Quote] Pg. 37 par. 2
> If the great Cosmos is seen as nothing but a chaos of particles without purpose or meaning, so man must be seen as nothing but a chaos of particles without purpose and meaning--a sensitive chaos perhaps, capable of suffering pain, anguish, and despair, but a chaos all the same (whether he likes it or not)--a rather unfortunate cosmic accident of no consequence whatsoever. 

> [!Quote] Pg. 39 par. 1
> Nothing can be known without there being an appropriate "instrument" in the makeup of the knower. This is the Great Truth of "*adaequatio*" (adequateness), which defines knowledge as *adaequatio rei et intellectus*-- the understanding of the knower must be *adequate* to the thing to be known.

> [!Quote] Pg. 41 par. 1
> For every one of us only those facts and phenomena "exist" for which we possess *adaequatio*, and as we are not entitled to assume that we are necessarily adequate to everything, at all times, and in whatever condition we may find ourselves, so we are not entitled to insist that something inaccessible to us has no existence at all and is nothing but a phantom of other people's imaginations.

> [!Quote] Pg. 44 par. 1
> When dealing with something representing a higher grade of significance or Level of Being than inanimate matter, the observer depends not only on the adequateness of his own higher qualities, perhaps "developed" through learning and training; he depends also on the adequateness of his "faith" or, to put it more conventionally, of his fundamental presuppositions and basic assumptions.

> [!Quote] Pg. 44 par. 2
> There is nothing more difficult than to become critically aware of the presuppositions of one's though. Everything can be seen directly except the eye through which we see. Every thought can be scrutinized directly except thge thought by which we scrutinize. A special effort, an effort of self-awareness, is needed: that almost impossible feat of thought recoiling upon itself--almost impossible but not quite. In fact, this is the power that makes man human and also capable of transcending his humanity.

> [!Quote] Pg. 53 par. 3
> The change of Western man's interest from "the slenderest knowledge that may be obtained of the highest things" (Thomas Aquinas) to mathematically precises knowledge of lesser things--"there being nothing in the world the knowledge of which would be more desireable or more useful" (Christian Huygens, 1629-1695)--marks a shift from what we might call "science for understanding" to "science for manipulation." The purpose of the former was the enlightenment of the person and his "liberation"; the purpose of the latter is power. "Knowledge itself is power," said Francis Bacon, and Descartes promised men they would become "masters and possessors of nature." In its more sophisticated development, "science for manipulation" tends almost inevitably to advance from the manipulation of nature to that of people.

> [!Quote] Pg. 54 par. 3
> The new science was mainly directed toward material power, a tendency which has meanwhile developed to such lengths that the enhancement of political and economic power is now generally taken as the first purpose of, and main justification for, expenditure on scientific work.

> [!Quote] Pg. 55 par. 1
> "Science for understanding" saw man as made in the image of God, the crowning glory of creation, and hence "in charge of" the world, because *blesse oblige*. "Science for manipulation," inevitably, sees man as nothing but an accidental product of evolution, a higher animal, a social animal, and an object for study by the same methods by which other phenomena of this world are to be studied, "objectively".

> [!Quote] Pg. 55 par. 2
> It is claimed that only such knowledge can be termed "scientific" and "objective" as is open to public verification or falsification by anybody who takes the necessary trouble; all the rest is dismissed as "unscientific" and "subjective." The use of these terms in the this manner is a grave abuse, for all knowledge is "subjective" inasmuch as it cannot exist otherwise than in the mind of a human subject, and the distinction between "scientific" and "unscientific" knowledge is question-begging, the only valid question about knowledge is that of its truth.
