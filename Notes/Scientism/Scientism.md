# Scientism
## Overview
- The belief that science and the scientific method are the best or only way to render truth about the world and reality.
	- Ordinally the term was defined to mean "methods and attitudes typical of or attributed to natural scientists"
	- Adopted as a pejorative term meaning "an exaggerated trust in the efficacy of the methods of natural science applied to all areas of investigation (such as philosophy, the social sciences, and the humanities)"
- Francis Bacon was seen as an early proponent of scientism, but this is a modern assertion.
- The term *scientism* frequently connotates a critique of the more extreme expressions of [[logical positivism]].
	- Also described as the dogmatic endorsement of scientific methods and the reduction of all knowledge to only that which is measured or [[confirmatory]].
- Most often interpreted as science applied "in excess"
	- Improper use of science or scientific claims
	- Belief that the methods of natural science form the only proper elements in any philosophical or other inquiry
		- Associated with the elimination of the psychological and spiritual dimensions of experience.
- Sometimes used to connote the opinion that empirical science constitutes the most authoritative worldview or most valuable part of human learning, sometimes to the complete exclusion of other opinions.

> Science [has] become a new magic and the man in the street [believes] in it the more the less he [understands] it.
