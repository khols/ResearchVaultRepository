## Points
### Linguistics: Roots of English
#### Dialects
- Dialect → when there is differences in a language but are still mutually intelligible
- Different dialects don’t cause trouble in understanding each other even if different words are used; they can be explained using the common understood words
- This can get messy, there is no definite line
	- __Mutual Intelligibility__ is the key
- Language vs dialect can be effected by politics or national boundaries
	- Hard to count how many languages
	- ==Just over 7,000==
#### Can a language die?
- Sure it can. Many languages become extinct; they have no more native speakers
	- Even in the Vatican, Latin is learned after their native languages 
- How would a new language be “born”?
	- Very hard to notice
		- Not noticeable until it is done
	- English was born at some point.
