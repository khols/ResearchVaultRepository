# Human Evolution

## 4:1 Demes, Reproductive Isolation, and Species
- **Deme**: a local population that interbreeds
- **Gene pool**: all the genetic information in a breeding population
- **Reproductive isolation**: mechanism that prevents two populations from interbreeding
- **Species**: groups of reproductively isolated organisms

- Living fossils → creatures that still look quite similar to their fossilized ancestors.

## Microevolution
- Small-scale evolution, such as changes in allele frequency, that occurs from one generation to the next
- Allows researches to closely document change and seek the source of it
- Observable and measurable evolution and genetic change
- Micro scale allows us to infer how macroevolution works
## Macroevolution
- Large-scale evolution, such as a speciation event, that occurs after hundreds or thousands of generations
- **Equilibrium**: A state in which the frequencies of a population’s alleles for a particular trait do not change over time
- The only difference is the time scale
## Got Milk? The LCT Phenotype
- Lactose intolerance is common around the world
	- Reported in native populations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas
- Lactose: A complex sugar composed of the linked simple sugars, glucose and galactose
- Lactase persistence: Inherited as an autosomal dominant gene (LCT) on chromosome 2
- Genotypes: PP (homozygous persistence), (homozygous non-persistence), and PR (heterozygous, intermediate enzyme output)
