# Human Evolution

## 4.1 Demes, Reproductive Isolation, and Species
- **Deme**: a local population that interbreeds
- **Gene pool**: all the genetic information in a breeding population
- **Reproductive isolation**: mechanism that prevents two populations from interbreeding
- **Species**: groups of reproductively isolated organisms

- Living fossils → creatures that still look quite similar to their fossilized ancestors.

### Microevolution
- Small-scale evolution, such as changes in allele frequency, that occurs from one generation to the next
- Allows researches to closely document change and seek the source of it
- Observable and measurable evolution and genetic change
- Micro scale allows us to infer how macroevolution works
### Macroevolution
- Large-scale evolution, such as a speciation event, that occurs after hundreds or thousands of generations
- **Equilibrium**: A state in which the frequencies of a population’s alleles for a particular trait do not change over time
- The only difference is the time scale
### Got Milk? The LCT Phenotype
- Lactose intolerance is common around the world
	- Reported in native populations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas
	- Typically humans lose the ability to digest lactose after they are weened off their mothers
- **Lactose**: A complex sugar composed of the linked simple sugars, glucose and galactose
- **Lactase persistence**: Inherited as an autosomal dominant gene (LCT) on chromosome 2
	- Most prevalent in western Europe, west Africa, and parts of east Africa in the Indian subcontinent; areas with rich histories of animal husbandry.
	- Connected to evolutionary advantages and milk consumption, and domesticated livestock
	- Fredrick Simmons → populations reliant on animal milk developed lactase persistence through natural selection
- **Genotypes**: PP (homozygous persistence), (homozygous non-persistence), and PR (heterozygous, intermediate enzyme output)
## 4.2 Hardy-Weinberg Law: Testing the Conditions of Genetic Equilibrium
- **Hardy-Weinberg law of equilibrium**: A mathematical model in population genetics that reflects the relationship between frequencies of alleles and of genotypes. 
	- $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$ 
	- $p$ → dominant allele
	- $p^2$ → number of genotypically dominant individuals (AA: $p^2$)
	- $2pq$ → number of all heterozygous individuals (Aa: $pq$)
	- $q^2$ → number of homozygous recessive individuals (aa: $q^2$)
	- Totaling $1$


$$\text{Suppose the frequency of the dominant allele(A) is 0.6 such that the frequency of the recessive allele(a) is 0.4, so that } 0.6 + 0.4 = 1$$
