# Human Evolution

## 4.1 Demes, Reproductive Isolation, and Species
- **Deme**: a local population that interbreeds
- **Gene pool**: all the genetic information in a breeding population
- **Reproductive isolation**: mechanism that prevents two populations from interbreeding
- **Species**: groups of reproductively isolated organisms

- Living fossils → creatures that still look quite similar to their fossilized ancestors.

### Microevolution
- Small-scale evolution, such as changes in allele frequency, that occurs from one generation to the next
- Allows researches to closely document change and seek the source of it
- Observable and measurable evolution and genetic change
- Micro scale allows us to infer how macroevolution works
### Macroevolution
- Large-scale evolution, such as a speciation event, that occurs after hundreds or thousands of generations
- **Equilibrium**: A state in which the frequencies of a population’s alleles for a particular trait do not change over time
- The only difference is the time scale
### Got Milk? The LCT Phenotype
- Lactose intolerance is common around the world
	- Reported in native populations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas
	- Typically humans lose the ability to digest lactose after they are weened off their mothers
- **Lactose**: A complex sugar composed of the linked simple sugars, glucose and galactose
- **Lactase persistence**: Inherited as an autosomal dominant gene (LCT) on chromosome 2
	- Most prevalent in western Europe, west Africa, and parts of east Africa in the Indian subcontinent; areas with rich histories of animal husbandry.
	- Connected to evolutionary advantages and milk consumption, and domesticated livestock
	- Fredrick Simmons → populations reliant on animal milk developed lactase persistence through natural selection
- **Genotypes**: PP (homozygous persistence), (homozygous non-persistence), and PR (heterozygous, intermediate enzyme output)
## 4.2 Hardy-Weinberg Law: Testing the Conditions of Genetic Equilibrium
- **Hardy-Weinberg law of equilibrium**: A mathematical model in population genetics that reflects the relationship between frequencies of alleles and of genotypes. 
	- $p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$ 
	- $p$ → dominant allele
	- $p^2$ → number of genotypically dominant individuals (AA: $p^2$)
	- $2pq$ → number of all heterozygous individuals (Aa: $pq$)
	- $q^2$ → number of homozygous recessive individuals (aa: $q^2$)
	- Totaling $1$
- Example
	- The frequency of the dominant allele, $A$, is $0.6$  
	- The frequency of the recessive allele, $a$, is $0.4$ 
	- $0.6 + 0.4 = 1$
	- Using the formula:
		- $AA: p^2 = 0.36$
		- $Aa: 2pq = 0.48$
		- $aa:q^2=0.16$
		- $0.36+0.48+0.16=1$
## 4.3 Mutation: The Only Source of New Alleles
- **Point mutation:**
	- One nucleotide base is replaced with another
		- I.e. thymine with cytosine
	- Synonymous
		- Production of same amino acid
		- No effect on the organism
	- Non-synonymous
		- Change in protein
		- Can have a dramatic effect on the protein and organism
- **Frameshift mutation:**
	- Nucleotide is inserted shifting all nucleotide down one
	- Dramatically changes the amino acids and proteins being formed
- **Transposable elements:**
	- Genes copy themselves and insert into different regions of the genome
- **Spontaneous mutations:**
	- One new mutation/person born
	- Random changes in DNA that occur during cell division
- **Induced mutations:**
	- Mutagens
		- Often have harmful effects
		- X-ray exposure
		- Toxic chemicals
		- Carcinogens
- **Duplications**:
	- Whole regions can be duplicated, while original DNA remains fine.
		- Can result in triplet chromosomes → Trisomy
			- **Klinefelter’s Syndrome**
				- Lankier/longer limbs and fingers
				- Infertile
## 4.4 Natural Selection: Advantageous Characteristics, Survival, and Reproduction
- **Fitness**: Average number of offspring produced by parents with a particular genotype compared to the number of offspring produced by parents with another genotype.
- Natural selection boils down to reproduction and death
- **Directional selection:**
	- Selection for one allele over the other
- **Stabilizing selection:**
	- Selection against the extremes of the phenotypic distribution
- **Disruptive selection:**
	- Selection for both extremes of the phenotypic distribution
