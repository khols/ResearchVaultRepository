## John Searle & AGI
### “Chinese” Room Experiment
- If you send symbols into a room and inside the room is a book of all natural language rules in symbolic form and a person, if the symbols are sent in translated and sent out, do the person and the room actually understand what is being translated. 
## Logical Language Parts
### Syntax
- First order logic
	-  $L_{1}=\{ v,\&,\to,\sim,(,),P,Q,\dots \}$
- Second order
	- $L_{2}=\{ L_{1},a,b,c,d,e,\dots, P\_,Q\_\ \_,R\_\ \_\ \_, \dots \}$
	- Arity → the number of arguments or operands taken by a function
		- $B_j$ : John is bald
	- Domain must be defined
		- Often is → Everything in the world
		- $_j$ = John Beverly
		- $B\_$ = is bald
### Semantics
- Truth tables for v,&,→,~
### Proof Theory
- Rules for preserving truth from premises to conclusion
	- I.e. validity
## Logic Recipes
- If
- Only if
- Iff (if and only if)
- And
- Or
- Neither nor
- Not both
- Not
### Bi-conditional
- (P→Q) & (Q→P) is the same as (P ←→ Q)
- It means “if and only if”
	- Sometimes denoted as “iff”
### Unless
- It can be described as either “if not” or “or”
	- ~(Q→P)
	- Q v P
### Neither Nor
- Neither P nor Q
	- ~(P v Q)
- Not both P & Q
	- ~(P & Q)
## Examples
- John and Tom are cousins.
	- Wrong answers:
		- (J & T) & C
		- P = John is cousin with Tom. Q = Tom is cousin with John. (P & Q)
	- New try:
		- Domain: everything in the world
		- $C\_ \ \_$ = is cousins (more properly: cousin of)
		- $_j$ = John
		- $_t$ = Tom
		- $C_{jt}$
